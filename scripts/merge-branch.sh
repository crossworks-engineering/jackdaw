# merge-branch.sh — land a finished feature branch on main: ff-only merge, then
# the version bump AS PART OF THE MERGE, on main, in the integrator clone.
# Ported from the mantle repo's script of the same name; same contract.
#
# Why: bumping on the feature branch makes every concurrent session edit the
# same version lines, so two sessions in flight means a guaranteed conflict at
# whichever rebase happens second. Merges into main are already serialized
# through the integrator — only it has main checked out — so a bump done HERE,
# as its own `release:` commit right after the merge, cannot race another
# session's. Feature branches never touch version fields at all; see the guard
# in bump-version.mjs.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/merge-branch.sh <branch> [patch|minor|major]
#     branch  the finished feature branch (e.g. feat/neat-dedup)
#     bump    version part to bump on main after the merge (default: patch)
#
# Runs from anywhere in the repo (a worktree included) — it resolves the
# integrator clone from the shared git dir and operates there. No tag, no push:
# pushing a v* tag cuts a release (release.yml + desktop.yml), and pushes stay
# explicit.

  still running is how a stale tree ships (see the mantle repo's v0.232.59).
