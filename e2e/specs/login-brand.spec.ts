/**
 * The sign-in screen wears the brain's own branding — an uploaded logo, else
 * the site name in the owner's chosen face, else the Jackdaw lockup (dev task
 * `db6b72e9`). The tab follows the same name (`b05a5f17`).
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT PROVE.
 *
 * The branding is resolved SERVER-side, from the public `GET /api/appearance`
 * that the root layout already fetches — so there is no request in the browser
 * for a test to intercept, and the two branded rungs cannot be driven from
 * here. (The mantle half HAS now shipped, so the payload does carry `siteName`,
 * `peerName` and the logo versions; what is still missing is a way for this
 * harness to SET them on the scratch brain mid-run.) The ladder itself is
 * therefore covered by `client/web/lib/brand.test.ts` — pure and exhaustive —
 * and what is covered HERE is everything that has to keep working on a brain
 * that has said nothing about itself:
 *
 *  - the Jackdaw lockup is still the fallback, in both themes;
 *  - the tab still says Jackdaw rather than going blank;
 *  - the title is in the SERVER's HTML, not painted in after hydration;
 *  - the form still renders and HYDRATES after the page was split into a
 *    server component plus a client child;
 *  - the small footer mark stays AWAY, so the unbranded screen does not show
 *    the Jackdaw mark twice.
 *
 * That last one is the real regression risk in this change and the reason this
 * file exists at all.
 *
 * ⚠ These have NOT been run: the scratch brain's Postgres container is gone
 * from the workstation, so the harness cannot bootstrap an owner and every
 * spec in the suite aborts in global setup. Every assertion below was instead
 * checked by hand against the same dev client at localhost:3100 — the DOM, the
 * 180px slot, the server-rendered <title>, the absent peer line, and React's
 * props on the email input. Run them for real when the box has a database
 * again; they are written to pass, not to be believed on trust.
