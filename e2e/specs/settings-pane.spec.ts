/**
 * The thirteen single-panel settings screens — Profile, Appearance, Backups… —
 * and the pane they sit in.
 *
 * ── What this file used to be ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `settings-hub.spec.ts`: a card per screen at `/settings`, the open card
 * selected, a stat line under five of them, and one collapsed "Settings" row
 * standing in for all thirteen in the sidebar. That hub is undone (c7af6a6).
 * The screens are flat sidebar rows again — so the menu FILTER finds them,
 * which the collapsed row had broken — `/settings` redirects to Profile, and
 * the cards are gone.
 *
 * What SURVIVED is the pane, because the pane was the good half of the hub.
 * `MeasuredPane` is `MasterDetail` minus the list: one measured column with a
 * draggable right edge, remembered per screen, and an empty spacer whose only
 * job is to give the content an edge to pull against. This file holds exactly
 * that, plus the two sidebar rules the revert leaned on.
 *
 * Not a row in `master-detail-screens.spec.ts`, deliberately: there is no
 * `[data-testid="list"]` to find. That absence is asserted below rather than
 * assumed, because a list coming back would mean the hub had.
 *
 * ⚠ Selectors. `react-resizable-panels` mirrors each panel's `id` onto
 * `data-testid`, so the content panel is `[data-testid="content"]`, the spacer
 * `[data-testid="spacer"]`, and the group carries the persistence id —
 * `measured-pane:settings:/settings/<name>`. Scope everything to that group:
 * the app shell has a resizable handle of its own for the nav rail.
