/**
 * `/pages/[id]` is a full-page route with no list beside it, so it had nothing
 * to drag against. It chose a `max-w-3xl` cap plus a "Full width" button —
 * `mx-auto` and two positions standing in for a measure the reader should just
 * set. Centred prose on a wide display, and a binary escape hatch.
 *
 * `MeasurePane` gives the route a measure of its own: a column that opens at a
 * width, CENTRED with the margins splitting the slack equally, carrying a
 * handle on its right edge with nothing capping it.
 *
 * ⚠️ This file used to assert the body tucked LEFT, against a panel-plus-spacer
 * cut that `MeasurePane` no longer uses — it is a centred `mx-auto` column with
 * its own `role="separator"`, not a `ResizablePanelGroup`, so the old assertions
 * looked for a panel group that was never going to be there and reported
 * "MeasurePane is gone" while it sat two lines away in the source. The earlier
 * cut pinned the page against the left edge of the WINDOW, which is why it went.
 *
 * Four assertions, four different regressions. Bring the button back and (1)
 * fails. Take the centring off and (2) fails. Lose the handle and (3) fails.
 * Put a `max-w-*` back inside the column and (4) fails — the measure widens and
 * the prose does not follow.
