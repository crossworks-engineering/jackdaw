 * one of the logins this device holds and any other login held here stays as
 * it was. (`tokenStore.set` would not do: it rotates the ACTIVE login's bearer,
 * which would file the member's bearer under someone else's row.)
 *
 * Split, the accept answer's cookie is on the API origin, which a split client
 * never uses, so without a bearer the person signs in at /login. Same-origin
 * that cookie is this very login's: without a bearer it is the session, and a
 * bearer left by an earlier login would ride along with every request and
 * answer for the wrong login, so it goes.
