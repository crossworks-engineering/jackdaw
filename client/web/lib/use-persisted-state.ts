/**
 * A preference that survives a reload, read WITHOUT breaking hydration.
 *
 * The pattern this replaces is everywhere in the app and is a real bug, not a
 * style question:
 *
 *     useState(() => localStorage.getItem('files:view') ?? 'list')
 *
 * The root layout is `force-dynamic`, so that component renders on the server —
 * where there is no `localStorage` — and again on the client, where there is.
 * Two different first renders is precisely what a hydration mismatch is: React
 * keeps the server's markup and the client's state, and the screen shows a
 * value nobody chose until something else happens to re-render it. The lazy
 * initialiser is also unguarded, and `localStorage` ACCESS (not just its
 * contents) throws in a browser set to block site data — which took the whole
 * member surface to the error page once already.
 *
 * So: render the fallback on both sides, then adopt the stored value in an
 * effect, which only ever runs on the client and only after hydration has
 * matched. The cost is one extra render for anyone who has a stored preference;
 * the alternative is a screen that is occasionally wrong and a crash in a
 * privacy-hardened browser.

 * Decide what a stored string means — the whole of the logic, kept pure so it

 * value written by an older build, a hand-edited one, and the `null` that
 * comes back when the key is absent.
