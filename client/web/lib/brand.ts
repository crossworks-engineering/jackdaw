 * The brain's own identity, read off the PUBLIC appearance payload.

 * ⚠ These four fields are not on `BrainAppearance` yet. `GET /api/appearance`
 * is public and already carries the colour theme, all four fonts and their
 * sizes; the site name, the peer name and whether a logo exists live behind
 * `GET /api/shell`, which needs a session — and the login screen runs before
 * there is one. Adding them to the public payload is the MANTLE half of this
 * work (dev task `db6b72e9`), and it has not shipped.
 *
 * So this reads them DEFENSIVELY off the same payload rather than waiting: the
 * type says they are absent, the runtime may already know better, and the
 * moment mantle adds them every surface below lights up with no change here.
 * Until then every field reads null and the screens fall back exactly as they
 * do today. That is the whole reason for the `unknown` cast in `readBrandFields`
 * — it is a forward-compatible read, not a type escape.
 *
 * The logo BYTES need nothing new: `GET /api/appearance/logo` is already public
 * and sha-addressed. What is missing is only the knowledge that one exists.

 * as identical as before — the whole complaint. It is also the name the login
 * screen already shows under the mark, so the tab and the screen agree.
 *
 * Distinct from `LoginBrand.name`, which is a MARK and stays the site name or
 * the product's: a peer name is an identifier for a box, not a thing to set in
 * a display face where a logo would go.
 *
 * The last fallback is kept either way — a brain that has said nothing at all
 * must not end up with a blank tab.
