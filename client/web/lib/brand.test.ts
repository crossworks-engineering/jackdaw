 * The login screen's branding ladder.
 *
 * This is the half of dev task `db6b72e9` that can be proven WITHOUT the mantle
 * change: the public `/api/appearance` payload does not carry `siteName`,
 * `peerName` or a logo flag yet, so every rung above the fallback is
 * unreachable through a real brain today. The resolver is pure, so it is
 * testable now — and when the endpoint grows the fields, these are the cases
 * that say what the screen will do.
