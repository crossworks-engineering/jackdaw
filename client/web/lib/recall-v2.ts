 * - A card PUT is FIELD-STICKY. `title` and `bodyMd` are required and
 *   replace. `useWhen`, `options` and `prompt` keep their current value when
 *   left out. From the owner, `prompt: true` makes the card a prompt (and
 *   confirms an agent's pending request) and `prompt: false` makes it
 *   knowledge (demoting a prompt, or dropping a pending request). So the
 *   editor sends `prompt` only when the owner moved the switch.
 * - The entry card (`start`) is always first and cannot be deleted.
