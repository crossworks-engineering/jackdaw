 * caller's ItemCaps (lib/contract/grants.ts):
 *
 * - `mayEdit`: the login may change it. False: no editor.
 * - `mayManage`: the login may delete or move it (a Moderator of its home).
 *   False: no Delete, no Move, no Grant Access.
 * - `readOnly: true` with `snapshotOf`: a snapshot copy of an accepted item
 *   (the author's copy, in its private or Former user workspace). Nobody
 *   edits it, moves it or shares it; its author may delete it.
 *
 * A field the brain does not send (a brain before the fix round) leaves that
 * control on: the brain decides each write, and a refusal shows in its own
 * words.

 * Pure: pinned by item-access.test.ts.
