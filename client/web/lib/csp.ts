/**
 * The Content Security Policy.
 *
 * The client keeps a 30-day bearer in localStorage, and `token-store.ts` rested
 * its threat model on "the client app's CSP" for months before one existed.
 * This is the first half of that CSP, and an honest account of why it is a
 * half.
 *
 * ── Where a CSP can actually be set in this app ──────────────────────────────
 * The policy wants to name the brain origin (connect-src is what stops an
 * injected script posting the bearer to an attacker), and that origin exists
 * ONLY in the running box's environment: one prebuilt image serves any brain,
 * which is why /env.js reads `MANTLE_SERVER_ORIGIN` per request instead of
 * baking it. Three ways to set the header were tried and MEASURED, not assumed:
 *
 *   1. `headers()` in next.config.ts — resolved at BUILD time. The variable was
 *      set in the server's environment and /env.js served it correctly, while
 *      the same value came out empty in a header declared there.
 *   2. Middleware, edge runtime — same result. Next bundles middleware
 *      separately and folds `process.env` into it at build: the built
 *      `.next/server/middleware.js` contained ZERO references to the variable.
 *   3. Middleware, `runtime: 'nodejs'`, and again reading the key through a
 *      variable to defeat static substitution — still empty, still zero
 *      references. Middleware cannot see runtime env here, full stop.
 *
 * Server components and route handlers CAN (their env reads survive into
 * `.next/server/chunks/`, which is why /env.js works). So the origin-dependent
 * half belongs in a `<meta http-equiv>` rendered by the root layout — meta
 * supports every directive below EXCEPT `frame-ancestors`, which is header-only
 * and happily needs no origin.
 *
 * ── What ships, and what it cost to get right ───────────────────────────────
 * Both halves are enforced now:
 *
 *   • {@link CSP_ENFORCED_STATIC} — origin-independent, a real header from
 *     next.config.ts.
 *   • {@link buildRuntimeCsp} — rendered as `<meta http-equiv>` by the root
 *     layout, which reads MANTLE_SERVER_ORIGIN per request.
 *
 * A CSP fails closed and SILENTLY: a wrong directive does not throw, it stops a
 * feature working and nobody finds out until a user does. Two directives were
 * wrong when this function was written-but-never-run, and both were found by
 * exercising them in a browser rather than by re-reading them:
 *
 *   • `frame-src 'self' blob:` blocked THREE surfaces, all cross-origin only in
 *     a split deployment and so invisible on the monolith — see the note there.
 *   • `img-src` without `https:` blocked every remote image in an email body,
 *     because a srcdoc iframe inherits this policy — see the note there.
 *
 * The meta is not literally the first node in <head> — Next hoists its own
 * preloads and framework scripts above it — but those are all 'self', and every
 * byte of app code runs after it, so the policy governs everything that matters.
 *
 * Still worth a signed-in pass with the console open, on the surfaces that
 * frame, eval or load bytes from somewhere unusual: the mini-app sandbox, the
 * drawing canvas, the formula screen, the email reading pane. Watch
 * `securitypolicyviolation`, not the rendering — a blocked iframe still fires
 * its load event, so the violation record is the only honest signal.
 */

/**
 * Enforced today, as a header. Every directive here is origin-independent and
 * was checked against the code rather than assumed:
 *
 *  - `base-uri`: no `<base href>` anywhere. (The one `<base>` in the tree sets
 *    `target` inside the email iframe's srcdoc, which this does not govern.)
 *  - `object-src`: no `<object>`/`<embed>` in the app at all.
 *  - `frame-ancestors`: nothing is known to embed the owner UI, and the desktop
 *    shell loads it top-level. If a customer ever needs to frame the team
 *    portal, this is the line to widen. Header-only — meta ignores it.
