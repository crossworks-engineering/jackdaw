/**
 * The tours this build knows. A deployment names one in `MANTLE_TOUR` (it
 * opens once per browser); `?tour=<id>` opens one on demand.
 *
 * Targets are `data-tour` attributes on the shell — `brand`, `profile`,
 * `assistant`, `help`, `main`, `activity`, and `nav:<href>` for every rail
 * item. A step whose target is not on screen (a collapsed rail, a scope that
 * hides the item) still renders: the card centres and says its piece.
 */

/**
 * The public demo. Written for a visitor who has never seen Mantle, and it
 * tells one story in three movements rather than naming screens:
 *
 *   1. everything you add is learned, automatically, and the brain knows
 *      itself (the dashboard, then files, mail and pages as the ways in);
 *   2. you ask with that context behind you (search, the agent, and the
 *      audit of a real answer with the passages it was built from);
 *   3. you steer the intelligence toward automation (agents and their tool
 *      groups, then MCP, where any client reaches the same brain).
 *
 * The demo is read-only, so no stop invites the visitor to add anything: each
 * one SHOWS the result of that step on seeded content and says what they
 * would do on a brain of their own. Every claim must be TRUE of the demo
 * brain in particular — it is generated, the assistant's turns are refused
 * at the edge, and the MCP connector is off — and the tour says so rather
 * than inviting a visitor to try something that cannot work. The rail's
 * default scope is Work, so stops on Settings and System screens frame the
 * content area rather than a rail item that is not on screen.
