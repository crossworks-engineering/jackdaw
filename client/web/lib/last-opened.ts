/**
 * The item each workspace section last had open, so entering the section
 * opens it again (Jason, 2026-10-03: "For workspace items, always load the
 * last page, note or file the user opened").
 *
 * - Per section, per login, per brain. The key names the brain's origin and
 *   the login (an admin's email, a member's login id), so on a shared device
 *   one login's last item never opens for another, and a member is only ever
 *   sent to an item the brain says they can read (see the probes below).
 * - In this browser's localStorage, a per-viewer convenience like the card
 *   density or the rail width. Not on the profile: it follows the device you
 *   were working on, not the person.
 * - Restored only on ENTRY to a section's bare index (`/pages`, nothing in
 *   the query) from outside it. A link to an item, or any query (`?q=`, a
 *   folder, a tag), wins; so does going from an item back to its own list,
 *   which is why the route before this one is tracked (`noteRoute`).
 * - An item that is gone or no longer readable is forgotten, and the normal
 *   index shows instead.
 *
 * Pure apart from the module-level route trail, so the rules are unit-tested
 * (last-opened.test.ts) without a DOM.
