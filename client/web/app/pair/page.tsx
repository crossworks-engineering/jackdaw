/**
 * Where a BROWSER lands when it scans the "Sign in on your phone" QR from
 * Settings → Logins (`<brain>/pair#v=1&code=…`). The Jackdaw app parses that
 * URL itself and never opens it; this page is for the system camera. On a
 * single-host install every non-/api path reaches this app, so without it the
 * scan fell through the session gate to the login screen.
 *
 * Public (see PUBLIC_PREFIXES in middleware.ts) and static: the code lives in
 * the URL fragment, which no server sees, and this page never reads or shows
 * it. It only says what to do. The brain serves the same words at its own
 * `/pair` for split deployments, where the QR points at the brain's origin.
