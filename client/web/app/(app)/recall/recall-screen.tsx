/**
 * The Recall screen, for a brain that says `features.recallV2` in /api/shell.
 * A brain older than that sends no `features` at all and gets a plain "needs
 * an update" state: the page-built (v1) screen it used to get was retired
 * with mantle R5. Branch on the capability, never on a version number.
 *
 * Reads the shell the app shell already fetched (same key; `staleTime:
 * Infinity` so this never adds a request of its own, but it still fetches if
 * the cache is somehow empty rather than spinning forever). It waits for the
 * answer rather than guessing, so the wrong state never flashes. A shell that
 * never answered reads as an older brain; a failed refetch keeps the answer it
 * had (see recallScreenOf).
