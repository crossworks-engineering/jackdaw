 * 2. Carry the version the brain answers with into the cache straight away,
 *    for the same reason, then refresh the catalog, the map and its log.
 * 3. On a stale version (another tab, or an agent: v2 serves an agent's card
 *    edit at once), reload the map and say so. Never retry: the owner has to
 *    see what changed before re-applying.
 *
 * `chain` records each of this tab's own writes (the version sent, and the
 * one it got back), so the card editor can tell the owner's own publish or
 * reorder apart from an agent's write. `warnings` holds the last write's
 * advisory warnings (an orphan card, an entry card with no options); they
 * never block, and the workbench shows them.
