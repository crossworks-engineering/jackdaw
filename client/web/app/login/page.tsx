/**
 * Owner sign-in screen, zero-secret flavor: no server session read (this app
 * can't verify one). Already-holding-a-bearer visitors bounce straight in;
 * fresh installs (GET /api/auth/bootstrap-state — public, boolean-only) get
 * the create-account variant, exactly like the monolith's first-run gate. Both
 * of those live in `LoginClient`.
 *
 * A SERVER component now, where it used to be a client one, for one reason:
 * the screen wears the BRAIN's branding — an uploaded logo, else the site name
 * in the owner's chosen face, else the Jackdaw lockup — and resolving that
 * after mount would flash the wrong brand on every load. `loadBrainAppearance`
 * is the same cached, public, server-to-server fetch the root layout already
 * awaits, so this costs no extra request; it reads no session and remains
 * zero-secret.
