/**
 * Owner sign-in. One transport in both topologies: POST /api/auth/token, and
 * the response bearer is held as a session of its own (the token store, which
 * also sets the presence cookie for the client middleware). A device can hold
 * several logins, and a login that is a bearer can be switched to by swapping
 * a token; one that is a cookie cannot.
 *
 *   split (the API is on another origin): that is all. No cross-origin
 *     cookies anywhere.
 *
 *   same-origin (single-host deploys, local dev): the browser-native loaders
 *     (`<img>`, `<iframe>`, download anchors) can only send a cookie, so the
 *     bearer is traded for one straight away (POST /api/auth/sso, the same
 *     upgrade the shell runs on every load) and the navigation waits for it.
 *     A box signed in bearer-only and holding no cookie is the bug that
 *     upgrade was written for.
 *
 * The topology test is a REAL origin comparison (`isCrossOrigin`), not
 * `apiBase set`, which is true on every same-origin box that configures one.
 *
 * Signup (first-run) creates the account first, then exchanges the same
 * credentials for a bearer like any other sign-in. A brain the installer set
 * up asks for its setup code too (`setupCodeRequired`); a setup-code refusal
 * shows on that field.
 *
 * Inside the desktop app, adding a login also offers a BRAIN ADDRESS. Left as
 * it is, the login is added here. Changed, nothing is signed in from this
 * window at all: the shell checks the address, saves the brain and opens that
 * brain's own window on its sign-in screen, email carried over. The password
 * is typed there, in the window of the brain it is for, because a window only
 * ever reaches its own brain's logins. The browser never shows the field: a
 * web client talks to the one brain it was deployed for.
