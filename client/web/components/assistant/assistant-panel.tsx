 *  grammars — plus react-markdown and marked. Imported statically it rode the
 *  shell onto EVERY signed-in route, about 1.3 MB of a 1.9 MB fixed cost, for a
 *  panel most loads never open. Same shape the help rail uses, for the same
 *  reason (`components/help/help-rail.tsx`).

/**
 * The full assistant, in one of three shapes — picked by the switcher in its
 * own header, and remembered, so recalling the assistant brings back the shape
 * and the place you left it in:
 *
 *  - **Docked column** (default, lg+): a right-hand column between the content
 *    and the activity rail, with `<main>` shrinking beside it (the shell
 *    publishes `--assistant-w`) — so the screen stays visible and interactive
 *    while you chat. On editor surfaces that means gutter marks, live edits and
 *    review highlights are seen as they happen. Draggable by the `RailHandle`
 *    on its inner edge, the same grip the nav and activity rails use.
 *
 *  - **Window** (lg+): a plain floating window. Move it by its header, size it
 *    by the corner grip. Nothing behind it is covered permanently and nothing
 *    reflows around it, which is the point — it is for reading a reply beside
 *    something the column would have pushed out of the way.
 *
 *  - **Overlay**: fills the same inset box as the shell's `<main>`, so it reads
 *    like any other screen rather than a floating window. This is also the
 *    fallback below lg, where neither a column nor a window has room: the two
 *    lg-only shapes simply do not apply and the base geometry stands.
 *
 * It is NOT mounted until first opened. It used to be — hidden via display:none
 * from page load — which bought three things, and only one of them was really
 * paid for by the mount:
 *
 *  - *A marker selection always has somewhere to land.* Still true, and never
 *    depended on this component: `useSurfaceAssist` writes pinned context,
 *    directives and selection into `AssistantDockProvider`, which is mounted by
 *    the shell and stays. The panel only ever read that state.
 *  - *Opening is instant.* Preserved by prefetching the chunk at idle below,
 *    which downloads the code without mounting a thing.
 *  - *The thread warms immediately.* This one genuinely goes: the transcript is
 *    now fetched when the panel first opens rather than on every page load.
 *    That is the trade, and it is the point — on a load where nobody opens the
 *    assistant, we were fetching a thread, a profile, polling runs every five
 *    seconds and building one ProseMirror editor per turn, all behind
 *    display:none.
 *
 * Once opened it stays mounted, so the transcript, scroll position, composer
 * draft, and any live turn stream survive a minimise/restore — or a change of
 * shape — without a re-fetch. `Esc` minimises.
