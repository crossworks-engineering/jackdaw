/**
 * The turn safety poll: the durable message row is the truth, the live stream
 * is an optimisation.
 *
 * A non-blocking turn (202) normally settles on the stream's terminal `done` /
 * `error` event. That event can fail to arrive while the turn itself finishes
 * fine: a dropped reconnect, or an inspecting corporate proxy that holds a
 * `text/event-stream` response back for minutes (seen in the field, 2026-09:
 * the POST got its 202, the agent replied in seconds, and the stream completed
 * 6-13 minutes later, so the user saw nothing and cancelled). Short requests
 * pass such a proxy untouched, so a plain poll of the durable rows always works.
 *
 * So both the stream and this poll are announcers, and whichever reports a
 * terminal state first wins. No proxy detection, no setting: the poll is one
 * small request every few seconds, only while a turn is in flight.
 *
 * Pure and injectable on purpose (fetch + timers), so it is testable without a
 * browser and shareable between the dock and the /assistant page.
