/**
 * The list + detail scaffold from the style guide (§8), with a draggable
 * divider. Owns the pane classes rather than leaving them to each screen,
 * because the rules that make it work are easy to drop and expensive to debug:
 * both panes need `min-h-0`, and the scrolling detail pane needs `relative` or
 * its overflow escapes into `<main>` and paints a second, clipping scrollbar.
 *
 * The layout is remembered per `id` in `localStorage`, so a width the user drags
 * survives a reload and a return visit.
 *
 * THREE panels, not two. The detail pane holds a measure of reading text, so it
 * gets its own width and a handle on its right edge rather than stretching to
 * whatever the window happens to be: on a wide display a full-bleed form runs
 * to 1200px line lengths and reads badly. The third panel is empty — it exists
 * only to give the detail a right edge to drag against. `listFills` and
 * `detailFills` each drop it, for a screen where one side should take the
 * slack instead.
 *
 * Below `md` there is no divider and no spacer: the panes stack, exactly as the
 * grid did.
 *
 * `listCollapsed` drives the list column to zero width WITHOUT unmounting it —
 * what focus mode needs. The list keeps its search text, scroll position and
 * page, so leaving focus mode puts the screen back as it was instead of
 * reloading it. Unmounting would be much simpler and is exactly wrong; see the
 * note on the prop.
