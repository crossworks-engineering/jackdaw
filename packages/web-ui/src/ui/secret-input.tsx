/**
 * An `Input` for a value that should not sit on screen while it is typed: a
 * password, an app password, an API key, a client secret, a token.
 *
 * Masked by default, with an eye button inside the right edge that flips it to
 * plain text and back. Two forms had hand-rolled this identically and every
 * other secret field had gone without, so this is the one implementation: a new
 * secret field gets the toggle by using this instead of `Input`.
 *
 * - **It owns the shown/hidden state.** No caller has ever needed to read it,
 *   and a field that starts revealed is the thing this exists to prevent.
 * - **Every `Input` prop and the ref pass through to the input**, so it drops
 *   into a `Field` unchanged: `id`, `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, `size`.
 *   `type` is the one prop it takes away, because it is the one it drives.
 * - **`className` styles the input; `wrapperClassName` styles the box around
 *   it.** The wrapper is `w-full` like `Input` itself. A field that is sized by
 *   its row (`w-1/3`, `flex-1`) says so on the wrapper.
 * - **`noun` names the thing in the button's label**: "Show password" by
 *   default, "Show secret", "Show key". The label is what a screen reader
 *   announces, so it should say what is about to appear.
 * - **`autoComplete` is the caller's.** The sign-in form leaves it alone so a
 *   password manager still fills it; a key or secret field passes `off`.
 *
 * The button is a `RowButton`, so it is `type="button"` and cannot submit the
 * form it sits in, and it draws the kit's focus ring. It stays in the tab order
 * on purpose: a keyboard user needs to check what they typed as much as anyone.
