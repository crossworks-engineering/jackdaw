/**
 * Flush a debounced draft on every way out of an editor.
 *
 * The three draft editors — Pages, Draw, Tables — each grew their own version
 * of this effect, and they did not agree. Tables and Draw listened for
 * `visibilitychange`; Pages listened for nothing and relied on unmount alone,
 * so a reload or a tab close inside its debounce window lost the typing. None
 * of the three heard the session expiring, which is a full navigation and so
 * never unmounts anything. Same shape, three copies, three different sets of
 * holes — the failure this audit keeps finding.
 *
 * The four ways out, all now covered:
 *
 *   • in-app navigation — React unmounts and the cleanup runs;
 *   • the tab is hidden, reloaded or closed — `visibilitychange`, which is the
 *     signal the Page Lifecycle guidance says to trust;
 *   • `pagehide` as its backstop, for the engines where a tab teardown does not
 *     reliably deliver `visibilitychange` first;
 *   • the session expires — see `session-flush.ts`.
 *
 * `flush` must be safe to call repeatedly and in any order: several of these
 * fire together on a normal tab close. Every caller's save already no-ops when
 * nothing changed, which is what makes that true.
 *
 * ⚠ `flush` should also clear its own debounce timer. It is called on paths
 * that are NOT unmount, where an armed timer would otherwise fire a redundant
 * save afterwards.
