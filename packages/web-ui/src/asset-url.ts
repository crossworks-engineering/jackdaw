/**
 * Client-side resolver for browser-native asset sources — the `<img>`/`<iframe>`/
 * download `src`s pointing at `/api/files/files/[id]?raw=1`,
 * `/api/attachments/[id]` and `/api/export/[id]` (the download-anchor export
 * surface). Those loaders can't send the `Authorization` header
 * that `apiFetch` uses, so in a detached/Electron client (cross-origin, no
 * session cookie) they'd 401.
 *
 * Same-origin (the normal case): returns the path unchanged — the session cookie
 * authenticates, exactly as before. Detached (`NEXT_PUBLIC_MANTLE_API_BASE` set):
 * targets the remote origin and appends the short-lived `?at=` asset token minted
 * by `GET /api/shell` (see `buildAssetToken`/`getOwnerForAsset` in lib/auth and
 * the asset-path acceptance in middleware.ts).
 *
 * ## The token arrives late, and then it rotates
 *
 * `assetUrl` is synchronous, but the token it signs with is not: `AppShell`
 * publishes it from the `GET /api/shell` response, and refreshes it on a timer
 * (`assetTokenRefreshDelayMs`). Anything resolved before that first publish gets
 * an unsigned URL that 401s, and nothing re-resolved it when the token landed.
 *
 * So the token is a tiny STORE, not a variable, with two ways to wait on it:
 *
 *   - `subscribeAssetToken` + `assetTokenVersion` — the `useSyncExternalStore`
 *     pair behind `useAssetUrl()`, for anything that resolves a URL while
 *     rendering. Re-renders on arrival AND on rotation.
 *   - `assetTokenReady()` — a promise for imperative callers that `fetch()` a
 *     signed URL from outside React (Excalidraw scene files, the draw-embed
 *     theme probe). Resolves immediately same-origin, where there is no token
 *     to wait for and blocking would be a hang for no reason.
 *
 * A hook alone could not have been the answer: three of the call sites are
 * plain modules feeding TipTap node views and Excalidraw, outside React.
