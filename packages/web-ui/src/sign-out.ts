/**
 * Signing out has to forget the session, and "the session" is more than the
 * credential.
 *
 * The credential was always cleared. What was not is everything else this tab
 * accumulated about the person who just left: the TanStack Query cache (their
 * profile, messages, settings), the short-lived asset token, and the memo
 * saying the cookie upgrade had already run. None of that is reachable from a
 * `tokenStore.clear()`.
 *
 * It survives because SIGNING OUT IS A CLIENT NAVIGATION. A 401 bounce is a
 * full page load and takes the whole heap with it, which is why this was never
 * seen there — but `router.push('/login')` keeps the JS context alive, so the
 * next person to sign in on the same tab was first shown the last one's data,
 * painted straight from cache before any request came back.
 *
 * Two ways to forget, and the difference matters:
 *
 *   • Module state this file can reach, reset directly below.
 *   • State owned by React — the query client lives in a provider — which
 *     registers a callback through `onSignOut`. That registry is its own leaf
 *     module (`session-reset.ts`) so the provider does not have to import this
 *     one; see the note there.

/**
 * Sign out across BOTH transports. Same-origin: POST /api/auth/logout clears
 * the session cookie, exactly as before. If a web bearer is held (the split
 * client), also revoke its device row (mobile-logout self-authenticates from
 * the bearer, idempotent) and clear the local store + presence cookie.
 * Callers navigate to /login themselves afterwards.
 *
 * The local clear happens whatever the network did: a sign-out that failed to
 * reach the brain must still leave nothing of this session on the machine.
 *
 * "This session" is the ACTIVE one. Its row leaves the device's list along
 * with its bearer (a refused bearer keeps its row, to sign back in to; a
 * sign-out is the person saying they are done with it). So does any other row
 * holding the same bearer: a copy of this login, not another one. Any other
 * login held on this device is left exactly as it was.
